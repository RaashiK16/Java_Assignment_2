# Java_Assignment_2

The file EmployeeManagementSystem.java contains the code for the question in assignment 2.
I have created a program which takes the information about employees as inputs from both the console and text file (employees.txt in this case) and writes the data into the main file (employee_log.txt in this case)

The same has been demonstrated below

### Demo

We first create the file "employees.txt" which contains some data of the employees

We then run the main() function which copies data from the file "employees.txt" and then asks for user input from the console to write the entered data into the file "employee_log.txt". A list of all the employees and their respective data is also displayed.

When the program is executed, we open the file "employee_log.txt" and we can clearly see that data from both the console and the file have been successfully written into the destination file. Along with the employee data, the source of the data (file or console) is also mentioned.
